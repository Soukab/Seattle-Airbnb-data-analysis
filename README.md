# Seattle-Airbnb-data-analysis

## Project Motivation

Based on Cross-Industry Standard Process of Data Mining, the Seatle Airbnb datasets were collected and investigated.
Three bisinuess questions were asked and answered:

1. How does the neighborhood affect the price?
2. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
3. What are the most influential factors to estimate price in Seattle Airbnb Listing Data?

## File Description

- A Descriptive Jupyter Notebook
- The datasets:
   calendar.csv
   listings.csv
   reviews.csv

In this project, I dived into the most recent Airbnb Boston and Seattle dataset and found many interesting phenomenom:
- We gathered Seattle Airbnb data, and cleaned it.
- We visualize data to explore the patterns and unswer some questions.
- We established a machine learning model to predict the rental price for both cities.
- We took a look at the feature importance of the trained model and check if they make sense.
- We list all the important amenities to get a better feeling how host can make more money by providing better services to meet customersâ€™ need.
